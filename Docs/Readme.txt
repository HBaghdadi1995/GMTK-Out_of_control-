================= DRUNKARD =================

The writing in this document will be sloppy as is to be expected of a solo developer who hasn't sleapt in almost 30 hours.

Hi, this is a game about driving a futeristic vehichle while drunk and trying not to crash into the edges. Have fun!!!
The highscore is in the console.
Sorry for the crappy concept, I made my own engine and this is all I could muster.

==== Copywrite ====
Please contact me <HBaghdadi1995@gmail.com> before using any of my assets. I would most likely aggree.

=== Code Writing ===
Most of the code here was either developed soley by me within the 48 hours provided for this game jam or is based on freely available open source libraries.
The only exception being the input manager which was codeveloped with some friends back in 2018.

=== Trouble Shooting ===
Make sure you have the src file in the same directory as your executable.

=== Opensource Libraries ===
The Licenses of third party tools can be seen in the license subdirectory.
They include

- GLAD
- GLFW
- STB
