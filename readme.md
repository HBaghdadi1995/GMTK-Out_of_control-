# Drunkard

This is a basic game written in C++ and OpenGL made for [the GMTK 2020 game jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020).

Due to the engine being written along side the game, the game itself is not very compilcated.

The game controls using WASD keys and ends when the player crashes onto the wall.

Score is racked up depending on distance moved and there is a random chance of keys being reassigned when pressed.
The highscore at the end is displayed on the console.

=== Code Writing ===
Most of the code here was either developed soley by me within the 48 hours provided for this game jam or is based on freely available open source libraries.
The only exception being the input manager which was codeveloped with some friends back in 2018.

=== Trouble Shooting ===
Make sure you have the src file in the same directory as your executable.
Due to a bug in the code, this game will not work with integrated GPUs, make sure to set it to run with a dedicated GPU instead.

=== Opensource Libraries ===
The Licenses of third party tools can be seen in the license subdirectory.
They include

- GLAD
- GLFW
- STB
